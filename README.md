# MagneticTB

A Mathematica program package MagneticTB, which can generate
the tight-binding model for arbitrary magnetic space group. The only
input parameters in MagneticTB are the (magnetic) space group number
and the orbital information in each Wyckoff positions. Some useful
functions including getting the matrix expression for symmetry operators,
manipulating the energy band structure by parameters and interfacing
with other software are also developed.
